Project Overview
A jewelry company wants to put in a bid to purchase a large set of diamonds, 
but is unsure how much it should bid. In this project, you will use the results from a predictive model 
to make a recommendation on how much the jewelry company should bid for the diamonds.

Project Details
A diamond distributor has recently decided to exit the market and has put up a set of 3,000 diamonds up for auction.
Seeing this as a great opportunity to expand its inventory, a jewelry company has shown interest in making a bid. 
To decide how much to bid, the companyâ€™s analytics team used a large database of diamond prices to build a linear regression model 
to predict the price of a diamond based on its attributes. You, as the business analysts, are tasked to apply that model to make a 
recommendation for how much the company should bid for the entire set of 3,000 diamonds.
